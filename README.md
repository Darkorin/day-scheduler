# day-scheduler

A simple day scheduler I did for homework. 
It checks the current date and sets the date area to it.
It then builds a table for all the business hours (9AM - 5PM)
and color codes them based on if they're past, present, or future.
It checks the local storage to see if there is any saved descriptions
and if there is, it loads them into the correct text area. 
The user may save new entries with the save button on the right side
of each row.
